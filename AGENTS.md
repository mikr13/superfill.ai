# AGENTS.md - AI Development Guide

## Purpose

This document guides AI assistants on how to work on this browser extension project systematically. It ensures consistent progress tracking, code quality, and follows the established architecture.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Product**: Cross-Browser Memory System - An AI-powered browser extension that stores user information once and intelligently auto-fills forms across websites.

**Tech Stack**:

- **Framework**: WXT (browser extension framework)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript 5.7+
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4
- **State**: Zustand
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK (BYOK for OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **Storage**: Browser Storage API (Phase 1) via WXT's storage wrapper
- **Runtime & Package management**: Bun
- **@webext-core/proxy-service**: For messaging between extension entrypoints. This allows us to directly call functions in other entrypoints without complex message passing & listeners.

## üìÅ Progress Tracking System

### Location

All progress tracking happens in the `development/` folder (git-ignored):

```sh
development/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md          # Current progress and task status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions.md         # Architecture decisions made during development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features.md          # Feature specifications and changes 
```

### Progress File Format (`development/progress.md`)

The progress file uses this structure:

```markdown
# Development Progress

**Last Updated**: [ISO Date]
**Current Phase**: [Phase Name]
**Overall Progress**: [X]%

## Week [N] - [Date Range]

## ü§ñ How AI Should Work on This Project

### 1. Before Starting Any Task

1. **Read the progress file**:

   ```md
   Read `development/progress.md` to understand current state
   ```

2. **Identify next task**:
   - Look for tasks marked as "In Progress" first
   - If none, pick highest priority "Pending" task
   - Check dependencies are completed

3. **Understand context**:
   - Read related completed tasks
   - Review technical decisions that might affect this task
   - Check for known issues that might be relevant

### 2. During Implementation

1. **Follow the architecture**:
   - Refer to main specification document
   - Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Use existing utilities and components
   - Use @webext-core/proxy-service for cross-entrypoint communication

2. **Code quality standards**:
   - Write type-safe code with proper interfaces
   - Handle errors gracefully (try-catch, null checks)
   - Use semantic HTML and accessible components
   - Follow existing naming conventions
   - DO NOT GENERATE ANY DOCUMENTATION OR .MD FILES UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED

3. **File organization**:

   ```sh
   src/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/              # shadcn components (don't modify)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features/        # Feature-specific components
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/              # AI integration utilities
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/         # Storage layer
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ matching/        # Form matching logic
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # General utilities
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/              # Zustand stores
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/               # TypeScript types/interfaces
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/               # React hooks
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entrypoints/         # Extension entry points
   ```

4. **Testing requirements**:
   - Test in development mode (`bun run dev`)
   - Test all happy paths
   - Test error cases
   - Verify in actual browser extension environment

### 3. After Completing a Task

1. **Update progress file**:

   ```markdown
   ### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
   - [x] TASK-001: Implement storage wrapper
     - **Files Modified**: `src/lib/storage/index.ts`
     - **Commit**: "Add browser storage wrapper with type safety"
     - **Notes**: Used WXT's storage API for cross-browser compatibility
   ```

2. **Document decisions**:
   If you made any architectural or technical decisions, add to `development/decisions.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## [Date] - Storage Layer Implementation
   **Decision**: Use WXT's storage API instead of direct browser.storage
   **Rationale**: Provides cross-browser compatibility and better TypeScript support
   **Alternatives**: Direct browser API, localforage
   **Trade-offs**: Adds WXT dependency but simplifies cross-browser testing
   ```

3. **Note any issues**:
   If you discovered issues, add to `development/issues.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## [Date] - Storage Size Limitations
   **Issue**: Browser.storage.local has 5MB limit in Chrome
   **Impact**: Large resume data might exceed limit
   **Workaround**: Compress data using LZ-string before storage
   **Resolution Plan**: Implement in storage layer, add size monitoring
   ```

4. **Update task status**:
   - Move task from "In Progress" or "Pending" to "Completed"
   - Check if completing this task unblocks others
   - Update dependencies for other tasks

### 4. When Encountering Blockers

1. **Document immediately**:

   ```markdown
   ### üöß In Progress
   - [ ] TASK-005: Implement AI categorization
     - **Status**: Blocked
     - **Blocker**: Need to finalize data schema for categories
     - **Next Steps**: Discuss with user, review common form fields
   ```

2. **Provide context**:
   - Explain what you tried
   - Share error messages or unexpected behavior
   - Suggest possible solutions

3. **Don't move forward**:
   - Don't make assumptions that could require major refactoring
   - Don't skip the blocked task and move to another that depends on it
   - Do move to an independent task if available

## üìã Task Prompt Template

When asking AI to implement a task, use this format:

```md

```

## üîç Code Review Checklist

Before marking a task complete, verify:

- [ ] **TypeScript**: No `any` types, proper interfaces defined
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks, null checks, user-friendly errors
- [ ] **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders, debounced expensive operations
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Consistency**: Follows existing patterns and naming conventions
- [ ] **Documentation**: JSDoc comment ONLY for complex functions with tricky/hacky/todo logic, inline comments ONLY for tricky/hacky/todo logic
- [ ] **Testing**: Manually tested in browser extension environment
- [ ] **Storage**: Efficient use of storage, proper serialization/deserialization
- [ ] **UI/UX**: Matches design system, responsive, good loading states

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use localStorage/sessionStorage**: Use browser.storage.local via WXT's storage API
2. **Don't use external CDNs**: All dependencies must be bundled
3. **Don't ignore TypeScript errors**: Fix them, don't use `@ts-ignore`
4. **Don't hardcode API keys**: Always use the BYOK system
5. **Don't make breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility with stored data
6. **Don't skip error handling**: All async operations need try-catch
7. **Don't forget cross-browser testing**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
8. **Don't use console.log in production**: Use proper logging utility
9. **Don't mutate state directly**: Use Zustand's set functions
10. **Don't create duplicate utilities**: Check if functionality already exists

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

1. **Use existing shadcn components**: Don't create custom components if shadcn has it
2. **Follow Tailwind classes**: Use utility classes, avoid custom CSS
3. **Maintain dark mode support**: Test in both light and dark themes
4. **Loading states**: Show loading spinners for async operations
5. **Error states**: Display user-friendly error messages
6. **Empty states**: Show helpful messages when no data exists
7. **Confirmation dialogs**: For destructive actions (delete, clear all)
8. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Implement and document keyboard navigation
9. **Responsive design**: Works in popup (400px width) and full page modes
10. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management, ARIA labels

## üìä Progress Reporting

At the end of each work session, provide a summary:

```markdown
## Session Summary - [Date]

   ```md
   feature/TASK-XXX-brief-description
   bugfix/TASK-XXX-brief-description
   ```

## üìö Reference Documents

- **Main Specification**: `/docs/specification.md`
- **Architecture Diagrams**: In main specification
- **API Documentation**: Generate as you go in `/docs/api/`
- **Component Documentation**: Use Storybook or inline JSDoc

## üÜò When You Need Help

If you're stuck or uncertain:

1. **Document the question** in progress file
2. **Provide context**: What you're trying to do, what you've tried
3. **Suggest options**: Possible approaches with pros/cons
4. **Highlight impact**: What's blocked by this decision
5. **Ask the user**: Present the question clearly for user input

## ‚ú® Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Implement the simplest version first, iterate
2. **Test continuously**: Don't accumulate untested code
3. **Document as you go**: Don't leave documentation for later
4. **Think about edge cases**: Empty states, error states, boundary conditions
5. **Consider performance**: Debounce, throttle, lazy load when appropriate
6. **Plan for Phase 2**: Don't make decisions that block cloud sync
7. **Keep it simple**: Don't over-engineer, YAGNI principle
8. **Be consistent**: Follow established patterns religiously
9. **Think about users**: Every decision should consider user experience
10. **Stay organized**: Update progress file religiously
