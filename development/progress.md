### üìã Pending Tasks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues & Blockers

None currently.

## Technical Decisions This Week

- **Decision**: Use TanStack Form instead of react-hook-form for TASK-008
  - **Rationale**: Better integration with modern React patterns, improved TypeScript support, more flexible validation
  - **Alternatives**: react-hook-form (removed), native form state
  - **Trade-offs**: New API to learn, but better developer experience and performance

- **Decision**: Use @tanstack/react-virtual for TASK-010 instead of pagination
  - **Rationale**: Better UX for browsing large lists, no page load interruptions, smooth scrolling
  - **Alternatives**: Traditional pagination (50 items/page as originally specified)
  - **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex implementation but significantly better performance
