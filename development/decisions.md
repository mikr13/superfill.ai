# Technical Decisions Log

## [2025-10-21] Memory Store Implementation

### Decision 1: Use Zustand with WXT Storage API

**Decision**: Use Zustand's persist middleware with WXT's storage API for state management and persistence.

**Rationale**:  

- WXT's storage API provides cross-browser compatibility
- Zustand's persist middleware handles serialization and hydration
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript support
- Built-in support for optimistic updates and error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:  

1. Redux Toolkit
   - More boilerplate
   - Larger bundle size
   - More complex setup

2. React Context + useReducer
   - No built-in persistence
   - Manual storage sync required
   - More code to maintain

**Trade-offs**:  

- ✅ Pros:
  - Simpler API surface
  - Built-in TypeScript support
  - Minimal boilerplate
  - Easy integration with WXT storage
  - Small bundle size

- ❌ Cons:
  - Less ecosystem tools compared to Redux
  - No Redux DevTools support out of the box

### Decision 2: Use superjson for State Serialization

**Decision**: Use superjson for serializing Zustand state in persist middleware.

**Rationale**:  

- Better handling of complex data types (Date, Map, Set)
- Preserves undefined values and special types
- Type-safe serialization/deserialization

**Alternatives Considered**:  

1. Default JSON.stringify/parse
   - Loses type information
   - No support for undefined
   - Date objects become strings

2. Custom serializer
   - More maintenance burden
   - Potential for bugs
   - Extra code to maintain

**Trade-offs**:  

- ✅ Pros:
  - Type-safe serialization
  - Handles complex types correctly
  - Well-maintained library
  - Small size increase

- ❌ Cons:
  - Additional dependency
  - Slightly increased bundle size
  - Potential version compatibility issues

### Decision 3: Implement Optimistic Updates

**Decision**: Use optimistic updates for all state mutations with rollback on error.

**Rationale**:  

- Better user experience with immediate feedback
- Reduces perceived latency
- Handles offline scenarios gracefully

**Alternatives Considered**:  

1. Wait for storage operations
   - Slower perceived performance
   - More visible loading states
   - Safer but worse UX

2. Queue-based updates
   - More complex implementation
   - Harder to reason about state
   - Better for offline-first apps

**Trade-offs**:  

- ✅ Pros:
  - Instant user feedback
  - Better perceived performance
  - Smoother UX
  - Works well with offline capabilities

- ❌ Cons:
  - More complex error handling
  - Need to handle edge cases
  - Potential for temporary state inconsistency
  - Must implement rollback logic

### Impact on Future Development

These decisions impact future work in several ways:

1. **Form Store Development**

   - Will follow same patterns as memory store
   - Can reuse optimistic update patterns
   - Will benefit from superjson serialization

2. **Settings Store**

   - Simpler implementation possible
   - Less need for optimistic updates
   - Can use same persistence layer

3. **Sync Implementation (Phase 2)**

   - superjson helps with data consistency
   - Optimistic updates support offline mode
   - Foundation for conflict resolution
